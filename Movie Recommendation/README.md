# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates how to build and 
evaluate models that suggest movies to users based on their preferences, using techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

# 📁 Project Structure
- Movie Recommendation.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, explanations, and outputs for the recommendation system.
- ml-100k: Contains MovieLens 100K Dataset, Stable benchmark dataset. 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies.
- README.md: Project overview and setup instructions.

#  🧠 Features
- Data loading and preprocessing of movie datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Content-based recommendation using movie metadata (e.g., genres, overview, cast)
- Collaborative filtering using user-movie ratings (if applicable)
- Similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation
- Recommendations generated based on user input or item similarity

# 📦 Requirements
Typical libraries used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

# 📊 Example Usage
You can try recommending movies similar to a given title by editing a specific cell (e.g., get_recommendations("The Matrix")).
